* All codes are run in MATLAB.

* "train1_org.txt" includes the whole patient sequences generated from Wael's github. 
   10-fold cross validation based on this file.

1. If you run "DataGeneration.m", you can generate datasets according to the ratio of hosptial size and non-correspondence event list according to overlap ratio. 
   Those are already in "Data" folder.

2. Through "Main.m", you can implement three different scenarios according to the ratio of hosptial size (80%/20%, 90%/10%, 95%/5%)
   Each scenario has three differnt overlap ratios (100%, 70%, 40%).

* All intermediate results will be saved.
